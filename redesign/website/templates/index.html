Have fun with Chinese cultural experiences too! Master Hong will give in-depth, step-by-step instruction on authentic Yang and Chen Taichi movements and Qigong warm-ups from Traditional Chinese Medicine, using the latest in physical learning science. Master Hong will also talk about how Taichi originated from ancient Chinese philosophy, Chinese medicine and Qigong. The beginning class will emphasize the skills of self-centering, body relaxation, and slow breathing while practicing form movements. You can expect increased flexibility, leg strength, coordination, and balance, as well as learning to be relaxed in an energetic way.</p> 

		<p>
		<strong>Taichi is an ideal aerobic exercise for life time. </strong>
		Do you know that practicing Taichi maintains spine health and increases bone density? It is beneficial to the cardio-vascular, respiratory, and nervous systems, digestive system, balance and also improves circulation of Chi. Master Hong's long-term Taichi students report that practicing Taichi helps alleviate hypertension, asthma, knee pain, and stress, while also improving mental, body strength and overall happiness.

	<div class="primary">
		<p><span class="initial-first-word">Born</span> in Jin Hua, China, Master Hong started practicing 
		Wushu with the Jin Hua Wu Shu Team when she was 8 years old. 
		She was the top Wushu athlete and Taichi champion in ZheJiang 
		province, China. Master Hong has a B.A. degree in 
		physical education in Wushu and Taichi from ZheJiang 
		Normal University, China. She became an assistant professor 
		and team coach of ZheJiang College of Traditional Chinese 
		Medicine in 1992. She coached the college Wushu and Taichi 
		Team and competed in national tournaments until she 
		immigrated to Seattle, US in 1994.</p>
	
		<p>Master Hong was named US &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; by USAWKF 
		in 1998, and competed on the US National Wushu Team in 
		the 5th World Wushu championship in Hong Kong in 1999, 
		where she ranked 7th among the top world professional 
		Taichi athletes.</p>

		<p>Master Hong's passion in Taichi originated from her 
		late teenage years at University, especially after she 
		studied Chinese Medicine for two years and visited Madam 
		Chen Lixing in XiAn, China. Master Hong's strong belief in 
		Taichi's therapeutic value in life and Taichi's powerful 
		martial application is a constant source of inspiration for 
		her. Master Hong is a lifetime student of Taichi Yang 
		family from Grandmaster Fu Shengyuan and  
		Grandmaster Chen Zhenglei of the Chen family, from Chen village, China.</p>
	
		<p>Currently, Master Hong is focused on practicing and teaching Taichi.

		instrument), Pipa (a traditional Chinese guitar-like instrument), and enjoys traveling with family 
		to experience different cultures around the world.</p>
