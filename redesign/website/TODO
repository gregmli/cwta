- Python 2.7 is no longer supported. Python3 is the standard
- However, Google App Engine dev_appserver.py requires Python 2.7 to run (even if the app is Python3)
- Library support in App Engine for Python3 is different - it seems like Jinja support isn't built in
- I've seen references to Flask with Python3 apps. Flask uses Jinja internally
