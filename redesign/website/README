4. Install gcloud components for Python
5. Use the start_dev_environment command to update gcloud and start the local dev server


For Future References:
This is still using Python 2.7. At some point it will need to be upgraded to use Python3, but App Engine support of Python3 is far from a seamless migration

- Python 2.7 is no longer supported. Python3 is the standard
- However, Google App Engine dev_appserver.py requires Python 2.7 to run (even if the app is Python3)
- Library support in App Engine for Python3 is different - it seems like Jinja support isn't built in
- I've seen references to Flask with Python3 apps. Flask uses Jinja internally
